# original_comedians

I don't know about you; but I'm getting tired of all of these unoriginal comedians sharing (stealing) jokes. Let's create something to hold these miscreants accountable! The models for this project will be comedians and jokes. Each comedian can have a whole bunch (see many) of jokes, but each joke can ONLY have one "owner" (comedian). Feel free to use generators, or build everything out by hand; whatever you're most comfortable with.

## Deliverables:
1. As a user, I should be able to see a list of all of the comedians that are tracked by the site.
2. As a user, I should be able to see all of the jokes that a particular comedian "owns".
3. As a user, I should be able to edit the comedians that are tracked on the site.
4. As a user, I should be able to edit the jokes that are tracked by the site.
